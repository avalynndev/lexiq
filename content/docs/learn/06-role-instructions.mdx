# Role Instructions and Personas

Assigning a role or persona to the AI can shape its responses and tone. By specifying a role, you help the AI adopt the right perspective, expertise, or style for the task at hand. This is especially useful for educational, professional, or creative applications.

## Why Use Roles?

- **Sets expectations:** The AI knows what kind of response is appropriate.
- **Improves relevance:** Responses are more likely to match the desired expertise or tone.
- **Enables creativity:** Roles can help the AI generate responses in a specific style or voice.

## Example

```
You are a professional chef. Explain how to make a perfect omelette.
```

**Expanded Example:**

```
You are a professional chef with 20 years of experience in French cuisine. Explain how to make a perfect omelette, including tips for choosing ingredients, cooking techniques, and common mistakes to avoid.
```

## Best Practices for Role Instructions

- Combine roles with context and instructions for best results.
- Use roles to control tone, formality, or expertise level.
