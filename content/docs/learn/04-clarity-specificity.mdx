# Clarity and Specificity in Prompts

The more clearly you state what you want, the better the AI can help you. Vague prompts lead to vague answers, while clear and specific prompts guide the AI to produce exactly what you need. Clarity and specificity are the foundation of effective prompt engineering.

## Why Clarity Matters

- **Reduces ambiguity:** The AI is less likely to misinterpret your request.
- **Improves consistency:** Clear prompts yield more reliable results across different runs.
- **Saves time:** You spend less time revising or clarifying outputs.

## Example

**Vague:**

```
Write about dogs.
```

**Clear:**

```
Write a 3-sentence paragraph about the history of guide dogs, including their origins and how they help people today.
```

**Another Example:**

**Vague:**

```
Explain climate change.
```

**Clear:**

```
Explain climate change in simple terms for a 10-year-old, using a real-world example and keeping the explanation under 100 words.
```

## Best Practices for Clarity and Specificity

- State your intent directly and avoid unnecessary jargon.
- Specify the format, length, and style you want.
- If your prompt could be interpreted in more than one way, clarify your intent.
- Use examples to illustrate your expectations.
- Break down complex requests into smaller, clear steps.
