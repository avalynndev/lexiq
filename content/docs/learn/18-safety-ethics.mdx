# Safety & Ethics

AI can sometimes produce unsafe or biased outputs. Use prompts to encourage ethical and safe responses. As a prompt engineer, you have a responsibility to consider the impact of your prompts and the outputs they generate.

## Why Safety and Ethics Matter

- **Protects users:** Ensures that outputs are appropriate and do not cause harm.
- **Reduces bias:** Helps prevent the spread of stereotypes or misinformation.
- **Builds trust:** Ethical practices foster user confidence in AI systems.

## Example

```
Only provide information that is safe and appropriate for all audiences.
```

**Expanded Example:**

```
You are an AI assistant for a children's educational website. Only provide information that is age-appropriate, safe, and free from bias. If a question is inappropriate, politely decline to answer and suggest a safer topic.
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Always review outputs for safety and bias, especially in sensitive contexts.
  Test your prompts with edge cases to identify potential risks.

## Best Practices for Safety & Ethics

- Avoid prompts that could lead to harmful, offensive, or biased outputs.
- Regularly review and update prompts to address new risks or concerns.
- Be transparent with users about how AI outputs are generated and reviewed.
