# Basic Prompt Structures

A well-structured prompt sets the stage for a great AI response. Understanding different prompt structures helps you communicate your intent clearly and get the results you want. Here are some common structures, with tips and expanded examples:

## 1. Instruction

Use direct instructions to tell the AI exactly what you want it to do.

```
Summarize the following article.
```

**Expanded Example:**

```
Summarize the following article in 3 sentences, focusing on the main arguments and key data points.
```

## 2. Question

Ask a specific question to get a focused answer.

```
What are the benefits of prompt engineering?
```

**Expanded Example:**

```
What are the top three benefits of learning prompt engineering for someone working in education?
```

## 3. Input + Instruction

Combine input data with a clear instruction for more complex tasks.

```
Text: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Task: Summarize the text above in one sentence.
```

**Expanded Example:**

```
Text: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Task: Rewrite the text above as a question suitable for a language learning exercise.
```

  Start simple! Clear instructions often work best. If the output isn't what you
  expect, try adding more detail or constraints.

## Best Practices for Prompt Structures

- Start with a simple structure, then iterate as needed.
- Be explicit about the format you want (e.g., list, paragraph, table).
- Use examples to show the desired output style.
- Break complex tasks into smaller, structured prompts.
