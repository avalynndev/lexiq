# Prompt Templates

Prompt templates help you save time and maintain consistency. They are reusable structures you can fill in for different tasks. Templates are especially useful for batch processing, team collaboration, or when you want to standardize outputs across multiple users or projects.

## Why Use Prompt Templates?

- **Efficiency:** Quickly generate prompts for similar tasks without starting from scratch.
- **Consistency:** Ensure outputs follow the same format and style.
- **Collaboration:** Share templates with others to promote best practices.

## Example

```
Summarize the following text in {n} sentences:
{text}
```

**Expanded Example:**

```
Translate the following list of phrases to Spanish. For each phrase, provide the translation and a brief explanation of any cultural nuances:
{phrases}
```
