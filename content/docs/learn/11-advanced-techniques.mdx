# Advanced Techniques: Chaining and Memory

For complex tasks, you can chain prompts or simulate memory to get better results. Advanced techniques help you tackle multi-step or context-heavy problems, and are especially useful for building sophisticated applications or workflows.

## Chaining Prompts

Break a big task into smaller steps and use the output of one prompt as the input for the next. This approach allows you to build up complex results in a controlled, modular way.

**Example:**

1. Prompt 1: "Summarize the following article."
2. Prompt 2: "Based on the summary, list three key challenges discussed."
3. Prompt 3: "For each challenge, suggest a possible solution."

## Simulating Memory

Remind the AI of previous context within your prompt. Since most models don't have persistent memory, you need to include relevant information from earlier steps in your input.

**Example:**

```
Earlier, you recommended three books: 'Dune,' 'The Hound of the Baskervilles,' and 'The Martian.' For each book, explain why it matches the user's interests in science fiction and mystery.
```

## Best Practices for Advanced Techniques

- Plan your workflow: Outline the steps before writing prompts.
- Pass relevant context between steps to maintain continuity.
- Test each step individually before combining them.
- Use advanced techniques for tasks like multi-turn conversations, data extraction, or decision-making processes.
