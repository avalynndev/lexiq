# Conversation

For chatbots, prompts should guide the flow of conversation and maintain context. Designing effective conversational prompts helps the AI respond naturally, ask relevant follow-up questions, and keep the dialogue engaging and coherent.

## Why Conversation Design Matters

- **Maintains context:** Keeps track of previous messages and user preferences.
- **Improves user experience:** Makes interactions feel more natural and helpful.
- **Enables multi-turn dialogue:** Supports back-and-forth exchanges, not just single responses.

## Example

```
You are a helpful assistant. Respond to the user's question and ask a follow-up.
```

**Expanded Example:**

```
You are a customer support chatbot for an online bookstore. When a user asks about a book, provide a brief summary, check if it's in stock, and ask if they want recommendations for similar titles. Remember the user's previous preferences during the conversation.
```

<Callout type="info">
  Keep track of previous messages to maintain context in multi-turn
  conversations. Use variables or memory features if your platform supports
  them.
</Callout>

## Best Practices for Conversational Prompts

- Reference previous user inputs or preferences in your prompts.
- Use follow-up questions to keep the conversation going.
- Be clear about the AI's role and the conversation's purpose.
- Test your chatbot with real users to identify gaps or confusing responses.
