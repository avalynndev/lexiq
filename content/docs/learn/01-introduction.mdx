# Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective instructions for AI models. The way you phrase your prompt can dramatically change the quality, relevance, and creativity of the AI's response. As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, the ability to communicate clearly with these systems is increasingly valuable.

## What is a Prompt?

A prompt is any input you give to an AI model to guide its output. This could be a question, a command, a description, or even a set of instructions. The more thoughtfully you design your prompt, the better the AI can understand and fulfill your request.
