# Handling Ambiguity

Ambiguous prompts can confuse the AI and lead to unexpected results. Be clear about what you want, and anticipate possible interpretations. Handling ambiguity is crucial for getting reliable and relevant outputs.

## Why Ambiguity Happens

- **Vague language:** Words or phrases with multiple meanings.
- **Missing context:** The AI doesn't have enough information to make the right choice.
- **Unclear instructions:** The prompt doesn't specify the desired format, length, or audience.

## Example

**Ambiguous:**

```
Write a summary.
```

**Clear:**

```
Write a 2-sentence summary of the following article for a high school audience, focusing on the main argument and key evidence.
```

**Another Example:**

**Ambiguous:**

```
Describe the process.
```

**Clear:**

```
Describe the process of photosynthesis in plants, using simple language and including the main steps and their purpose.
```
